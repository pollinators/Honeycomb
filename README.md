Pollinator Survey Research
---


##### This is the home of our industry project for CMPEN 482W.

The project is a collaborative work with 
Medora Ebersole (from the College of Arts & Architecture at Penn State)
, Ted Papaioannou, Szymon Cymbalski, Mario Leone, and Manjot Singh, and others. We hope to create an application to collect research about pollinators world-wide.
